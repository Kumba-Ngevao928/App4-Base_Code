Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal for the code is to accurately differentiate between a user's symptoms, to determine whether they are down with the flu or COVID-19. 
This is crucial as these illnesses often exhibit similar symptoms, making them prone to misdiagnosis in the absence of sample testing.
